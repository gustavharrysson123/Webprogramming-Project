# Project idea

Our idea is to create an application that allows the user to create, categorise and view recipes. From these recipes the user can create shopping lists that can be grouped with menus. 

## Packages

We are planning to use the angular material package for styling and @ngrx/store for redux state management.    

## Functionality

Core functionality:
Navigation
Sidebar with tabs for every functionality
Recipes
Create recipe and choose which recipe category it belongs to
View all recipes by category
Option to add image of the recipe
Menu
Create a menu by choosing recipes that will be included in it.
Add ingredients to shopping list from recipe by choosing portions and ingredients that need to be bought
View shopping list 
Nice-to-have:
Send shopping list for the week to a specified email address 
Calendar with recipes on specific dates
